Nvidia Tracker Unit
===================

The Nvidia Tracker Unit is designed for use of tracking algorithms implemented through the Nvidia ``Gst-nvtracker`` plugin, including the Nvidia NvMultiObjectTracker tracking library.

The Nvidia Tracker Unit is specified in the Savant module configuration with the ``nvtracker`` unit:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - element: nvtracker

The element does not have any Savant-specific configuration parameters. All possible parameters must be specified under the ``element.properties`` section and will be passed directly to the Gstreamer element. You can find a complete list of possible parameters at the Gst-nvtracker properties `link <https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_plugin_gst-nvtracker.html#gst-properties>`_.

The mandatory configuration parameter for nvtracker is ``properties.ll-lib-file``, which specifies the path to the tracking library. The configuration that uses the NvMultiObjectTracker library provided within Deepstream looks like the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - element: nvtracker
      properties:
        ll-lib-file: /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/lib/libnvds_nvmultiobjecttracker.so

To fine-tune the tracker, you can pass a tracking configuration file to the library using the ``properties.ll-config-file parameter``:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - element: nvtracker
      properties:
        ll-lib-file: /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/lib/libnvds_nvmultiobjecttracker.so
        ll-config-file: ${oc.env:APP_PATH}/samples/line_crossing/config_tracker_NvDCF_perf.yml

In the example above, ``config_tracker_NvDCF_perf.yml`` specifies a configuration file for one of the tracking presets provided by Nvidia. This and other configuration files can be found in the DeepStream development image at ``/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.2/samples/configs/deepstream-app``. Nvidia provides four different approaches to tracking, which are described in detail in the Gst-nvtracker Tracker library `documentation <https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_plugin_gst-nvtracker.html#id9>`__.

The **IOU** tracker is the most lightweight, but suitable only for the simplest scenes. The configuration file is ``config_tracker_IOU.yml``.

**NvSORT** is also also a high performance with improved association due to the use of the Kalman filter. The configuration file is ``config_tracker_NvSORT.yml``.

**NvDeepSORT** is a visual tracker that uses a GPU-based ReID model to improve association in a complex environment. The configuration file is ``config_tracker_NvDeepSORT.yml``.

**NvDCF** is a flexible tracker based on discriminative correlation filter, which also can use ReID. Three configuration presets are available:

* ``config_tracker_NvDCF_accuracy.yml``;
* ``config_tracker_NvDCF_perf.yml``;
* ``config_tracker_NvDCF_max_perf.yml``.

More information about parameters of Nvidia's object tracking library can be found in NvMultiObjectTracker `documentation <https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/dev-guide/text/DS_plugin_gst-nvtracker.html#configuration-parameters>`__.

As an alternative to Nvidia's trackers, it is possible to implement custom object tracking, which is described in more detail in advanced topics.

Phantom Object Creation Modifier
--------------------------------

By default, the vanilla Nvidia tracker can create phantom objects not associated with objects in the scene. It can introduce weird and unexpected results for certain videos and requires additional checks on the code side.

To overcome that, Savant introduces an alternated behavior when all such phantom objects are removed immediately after a tracker unit to help developer simplify the code. However, you can activate the default behavior with the following attribute:


.. code-block:: yaml

    - element: nvtracker
      properties:
        disable-obj-init: false
