Examples
========

We develop example pipelines to help people get acquainted with Savant. Every example contains a short readme instruction on how to run it. Some examples also have full-fledged articles published on Medium.

Currently available examples are:

- PeopleNet detector example, also covers OpenCV CUDA integration;
- OpenCV CUDA MOG2 background subtraction;
- Deepstream test2 example (car detection and classification), which runs one a primary detector and 3 classifiers;

Examples are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/insight-platform/Savant/tree/develop/samples>`_.
