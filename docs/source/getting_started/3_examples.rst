Examples
========

We developed example pipelines to help people get acquainted with Savant. Every example contains a short readme instruction on how to run it. Certain examples are also accompanied by the articles published on Medium.

Examples are available on `GitHub <https://github.com/insight-platform/Savant/tree/develop/samples>`_.

Full-Featured Examples
----------------------

- People detector/tracker `example <https://github.com/insight-platform/Savant/tree/develop/samples/peoplenet_detector>`__, also covers OpenCV CUDA;
- DeepStream car detection, tracking and classification `example <https://github.com/insight-platform/Savant/tree/develop/samples/nvidia_car_classification>`__, which runs a primary detector, 3 classifiers and the Nvidia tracker;
- Ready-to-use traffic (people, cars, etc.) `counting <https://github.com/insight-platform/Savant/tree/develop/samples/traffic_meter>`__ with YOLOv8 or PeopleNet, and the Nvidia tracker;
- Age/gender prediction `example <https://github.com/insight-platform/Savant/tree/develop/samples/age_gender_recognition>`__ featuring facial detection, tracking, age/gender prediction and predictions normalization based on tracking.
