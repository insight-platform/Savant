Welcome To Savant Documentation
===================================

:repo-link:`Savant` is an open-source, high-level Python/C++/Rust framework for building real-time, streaming, highly efficient computer vision AI applications on the Nvidia stack. It makes it possible to develop dynamic, fault-tolerant inference pipelines that utilize the best Nvidia approaches for data center and edge accelerators very quickly. Savant supports both discrete Nvidia GPUs and Jetson edge devices.

Why Savant Was Developed?
-------------------------

We developed it to give deep learning and computer vision engineers a pipeline development framework that is both easy-to-use and implements the best Nvidia technologies.

Savant is a high-level framework on Nvidia `DeepStream SDK <https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk>`_, which hides complexity and provides practical functions for implementing blazingly fast streaming AI applications.

In Savant, the pipeline is a sequence of declarative (YAML) blocks with user-defined functions in Python.

Key Features
------------

Savant is packed with several killer features which skyrocket the development of Deepstream applications.

üîß All You Need for Building Real-Life Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Savant supports everything you need for developing advanced pipelines: detection, classification, segmentation, tracking, and custom pre- and post-processing for meta and images.

We have implemented samples demonstrating pipelines you can build with Savant. Visit the [samples](samples) folder to learn more.

üöÄ High Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Savant is designed to be fast: it works on top of DeepStream - the fastest SDK for video analytics. Even the heavyweight segmentation models can run in real-time on Savant. See the [Performance Regression Tracking Dashboard](docs/performance.md) for the latest performance results.

üåê Works On Edge and Data Center Equipment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The framework supports running the pipelines on both Nvidia's edge devices (Jetson Family) and data center devices (Tesla, Quadro, etc.) with minor or zero changes.

‚ù§Ô∏è Cloud-Ready
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Savant pipelines run in Docker containers. We provide images for x86+dGPU and Jetson hardware.

### ‚ö° Low Latency and High Capacity Processing

Savant can be configured to execute a pipeline in real-time, skipping data when running out of capacity or in high capacity mode, which guarantees the processing of all the data, maximizing the utilization of the available resources.

ü§ù Ready-To-Use API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A pipeline is a self-sufficient service communicating with the world via high-performance streaming API. Whether developers use provided adapters or Client SDK, both approaches use the API.

üìÅ Advanced Data Protocol
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The framework universally uses a common protocol for both video and metadata delivery. The protocol is highly flexible, allowing video-related information alongside arbitrary structures useful for IoT and 3rd-party integrations.

‚è± OpenTelemetry Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Savant, you can precisely instrument pipelines with OpenTelemetry: a unified monitoring solution. You can use sampled or complete traces to balance the performance and precision. The traces can span from edge to core to business logic through network and storage because their propagation is supported by the Savant protocol.

üß∞ Client SDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide Python-based SDK to interact with Savant pipelines (ingest and receive data). It enables simple integration with 3rd-party services. Client SDK is integrated with OpenTelemetry providing programmatic access to the pipeline traces and logs.

üßò Development Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Software development for vanilla DeepStream is a pain. Savant provides a Development Server tool, which enables dynamic reloading of changed code without pipeline restarts. It helps to develop and debug pipelines much faster. Altogether with Client SDK, it makes the development of DeepStream-enabled applications really simple. With the Development Server, you can develop remotely on a Jetson device or server right from your IDE.

üîÄ Dynamic Sources Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Savant, you can dynamically attach and detach sources and sinks to the pipeline without reloading. The framework resiliently handles situations related to source/sink outages.

üèπ Handy Source and Sink Adapters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The communication interface is not limited to Client SDK: we provide several ready-to-use adapters, which you can use "as is" or modify for your needs.

üéØ Dynamic Parameters Ingestion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Advanced ML pipelines may require information from the external environment for their work. The framework enables dynamic configuration of the pipeline with:

- ingested frame attributes passed in per-frame metadata;
- Etcd's attributes watched and instantly applied;
- 3rd-party attributes, which are received through user-defined functions.

üñº OpenCV CUDA Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Savant supports custom OpenCV CUDA bindings enabling operations on DeepStream's in-GPU frames with a broad range of OpenCV CUDA functions: the feature helps in implementing highly efficient video transformations, including but not limited to blurring, cropping, clipping, applying banners and graphical elements over the frame, and others. The feature is available from Python.

‚Üª Rotated Detection Models Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We frequently deal with the models resulting in bounding boxes rotated relative to a video frame (oriented bounding boxes). For example, it is often the case with bird-eye cameras observing the underlying area from a high point.

Such cases may require detecting the objects with minimal overlap. To achieve that, special models are used which generate bounding boxes that are not orthogonal to the frame axis. Take a look at `RAPiD <https://vip.bu.edu/projects/vsns/cossy/fisheye/rapid/>`_ to find more.

‚á∂ Parallelization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Savant supports processing parallelization; it helps to utilize the available resources to the maximum. The parallelization is achieved by running the pipeline stages in separate threads. Despite flow control-related Python code is not parallel; the developer can utilize GIL-releasing mechanisms to achieve the desired parallelization with NumPy, Numba, or custom native code in C++ or Rust.
