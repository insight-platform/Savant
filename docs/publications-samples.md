## ML/AI Examples

To help novice users to dive into Savant, we have prepared several ready-to-use examples, which one can download, build
and launch. In addition, every sample includes all you need to run it: the source code, models, build file, sample data,
and a short README.md which covers the purpose and gives a brief explanation. Some samples are also accompanied by the
how-to guides published on the Medium portal, where one can study them step-by-step.

### People Detecting, Tracking and Anonymizing (Peoplenet, Nvidia Tracker, OpenCV-CUDA)

![demo-0 2 0_dia](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15047882/227759263-020154c8-7ac5-48fa-8167-129151b16421.png)

A simple pipeline that uses standard [Nvidia PeopleNet](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tao/models/peoplenet) model to detect persons and their faces in the video. The faces are matched versus bodies and blurred with the integrated OpenCV CUDA functionality. There is also a simple unreliable tracker that helps reduce flickering of boxes.

GPU-accelerated blurring made with OpenCV is a killer feature of this demonstration. It enables very fast and efficient face blurring without CPU utilization.
