# People detection, tracking and face blurring (PeopleNet, Nvidia Tracker, OpenCV CUDA)

A simple pipeline that uses standard [Nvidia PeopleNet](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/tao/models/peoplenet) model to detect persons and their faces in the video. The faces are matched versus bodies and blurred with the integrated OpenCV CUDA functionality. There is also a simple unreliable tracker that helps reduce flickering of boxes.

GPU-accelerated blurring made with OpenCV is a killer feature of this demonstration. It enables very fast and efficient face blurring without CPU utilization.

The **Green** Icon represents how many people with blurred faces in the scene.

A step-by-step [tutorial](https://blog.savant-ai.io/meet-savant-a-new-high-performance-python-video-analytics-framework-for-nvidia-hardware-22cc830ead4d?source=friends_link&sk=c7169b378b31451ab8de3d882c22a774).

Tested on platforms:

- Xavier NX, Xavier AGX;
- Nvidia Ampere.

Demonstrated operational modes:

- real-time processing: RTSP streams (multiple sources at once);
- capacity processing: directory of files (FPS).

Demonstrated adapters:
- RTSP source adapter;
- video file source adapter;
- Always-ON RTSP sink adapter;
- Video/Metadata sink adapter.


**Note**: Ubuntu 22.04 runtime configuration [guide](../../docs/runtime-configuration.md) helps to configure the runtime to run Savant pipelines.

Run the demo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/insight-platform/Savant.git
cd Savant/samples/peoplenet_detector
git lfs pull

# if x86
../../utils/check-environment-compatible && docker compose -f docker-compose.x86.yml up

# if Jetson
../../utils/check-environment-compatible && docker compose -f docker-compose.l4t.yml up

# open 'rtsp://127.0.0.1:554/stream' in your player
# or visit 'http://127.0.0.1:888/stream/' (LL-HLS)

# Ctrl+C to stop running the compose bundle

# to get back to project root
cd ../..
```

## Performance Measurement

Download the video file to your local folder. For example, create a data folder and download the video into it (all commands must be executed from the root directory of the project Savant)

```bash
# you are expected to be in Savant/ directory

mkdir -p data && curl -o data/Free_City_Street_Footage.mp4 \
   https://eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com/savant-data/demo/Free_City_Street_Footage.mp4
```

Next, if you haven't run the sample in the default mode yet (following the instructions above), run

```bash
docker compose -f samples/peoplenet_detector/docker-compose.x86.yml build module
```

or

```bash
docker compose -f samples/peoplenet_detector/docker-compose.l4t.yml build module
```

to build the module docker image.

Now you are ready to run the performance benchmark with the following command:

```bash
./samples/peoplenet_detector/run_perf.sh
```
