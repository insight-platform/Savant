BaseConfig:
  minDetectorConfidence: 0.1345    # If the confidence of a detector bbox is lower than this, then it won't be considered for tracking

TargetManagement:
  enableBboxUnClipping: 0    # In case the bbox is likely to be clipped by image border, unclip bbox
  maxTargetsPerStream: 300    # Max number of targets to track per stream. Recommended to set >10. Note: this value should account for the targets being tracked in shadow mode as well. Max value depends on the GPU memory capacity

  # [Creation & Termination Policy]
  minIouDiff4NewTarget: 0.5780    # If the IOU between the newly detected object and any of the existing targets is higher than this threshold, this newly detected object will be discarded.
  minTrackerConfidence: 0.8216    # If the confidence of an object tracker is lower than this on the fly, then it will be tracked in shadow mode. Valid Range: [0.0, 1.0]
  probationAge: 5    # 5 # If the target's age exceeds this, the target will be considered to be valid.
  maxShadowTrackingAge: 26    # Max length of shadow tracking. If the shadowTrackingAge exceeds this limit, the tracker will be terminated.
  earlyTerminationAge: 1    # If the shadowTrackingAge reaches this threshold while in TENTATIVE period, the the target will be terminated prematurely.

TrajectoryManagement:
  useUniqueID: 0    # Use 64-bit long Unique ID when assignining tracker ID. Default is [true]

DataAssociator:
  dataAssociatorType: 0    # the type of data associator among { DEFAULT= 0 }
  associationMatcherType: 1    # the type of matching algorithm among { GREEDY=0, CASCADED=1 }
  checkClassMatch: 1    # If checked, only the same-class objects are associated with each other. Default: true

  # [Association Metric: Thresholds for valid candidates]
  minMatchingScore4Overall: 0.2543    # Min total score
  minMatchingScore4SizeSimilarity: 0.4019    # Min bbox size similarity score
  minMatchingScore4Iou: 0.2159    # Min IOU score
  matchingScoreWeight4SizeSimilarity: 0.1365    # Weight for the Size-similarity score
  matchingScoreWeight4Iou: 0.3836    # Weight for the IOU score

  # [Association Metric: Tentative detections] only uses iou similarity for tentative detections
  tentativeDetectorConfidence: 0.2331    # If a detection's confidence is lower than this but higher than minDetectorConfidence, then it's considered as a tentative detection
  minMatchingScore4TentativeIou: 0.2867    # Min iou threshold to match targets and tentative detection
  usePrediction4Assoc: 1    # use the predicted state info for association instead of the past known states

StateEstimator:
  stateEstimatorType: 2    # the type of state estimator among { DUMMY=0, SIMPLE=1, REGULAR=2 }

  # [Dynamics Modeling]
  noiseWeightVar4Loc: 0.0301    # weight of process and measurement noise for bbox center; if set, location noise will be proportional to box height
  noiseWeightVar4Vel: 0.0017    # weight of process and measurement noise for velocity; if set, velocity noise will be proportional to box height
  useAspectRatio: 1    # use aspect ratio in Kalman filter's observation
