  # Edges list contain the string tags for the polygon edges.

  # the 2nd is the edge between the 2nd and 3rd points and so on.
  # If the edge tag is null, then it is disabled:
  # the edge is not drawn on the frame and the crossings are not checked for it.
  # Do not use "->" or "+" in the edge tags
  # as these strings serve as separators for dynamically generated crossing direction names
