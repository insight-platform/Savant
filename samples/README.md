## ML/AI Examples

To help novice users to dive into Savant, we have prepared several ready-to-use examples, which one can download, build
and launch. In addition, every sample includes all you need to run it: the source code, models, build file, sample data,
and a short README.md which covers the purpose and gives a brief explanation. Some samples are also accompanied by the
how-to guides published on the Medium portal, where one can study them step-by-step.
