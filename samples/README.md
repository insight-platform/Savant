## ML/AI Examples

To help novice users to dive into Savant, we have prepared several ready-to-use examples, which one can download, build
and launch. In addition, every sample includes all you need to run it: the source code, models, build file, sample data,
and a short README.md which covers the purpose and gives a brief explanation. Some samples are also accompanied by the
how-to guides published on the Medium portal, where one can study them step-by-step.

### Multiple RTSP Streams Demo

A simple pipeline demonstrates how multiplexed processing works in Savant. In the demo, two RTSP streams are ingested in the module and processed with the PeopleNet model.

Sample Location: [multiple_rtsp](./multiple_rtsp)

### Testing RTSP Camera Compatibility

A very primitive source-sink pipeline testing that RTSP cam normally processed by NVDEC and thus, is compatible with Savant.

Location: [rtsp_cam_compatibility_test](./rtsp_cam_compatibility_test)

### Multiple GigE Vision Cameras Demo

A simple pipeline demonstrates how GigE Vision Source Adapter works in Savant. In the demo video from one GigE Vision camera is passed as raw-rgba frames, and another one is passed as HEVC-encoded frames. Both streams are passed to Always-On-RTSP sinks.

Sample Location: [multiple_gige](./multiple_gige)

### Source Adapter With JSON Metadata

A demo showing how to inject ground truth metadata into frames and use them to estimate the model performance.

Sample location: [source_adapter_with_json_metadata](./source_adapter_with_json_metadata)

### OpenTelemetry Sample

A sample demonstrating the use of OpenTelemetry in Savant.

Sample location: [telemetry](./telemetry)

### Kafka-Redis Adapters Demo

A sample demonstrating the use of Kafka-Redis adapters in Savant.

Sample location: [kafka_redis_adapter](./kafka_redis_adapter)
