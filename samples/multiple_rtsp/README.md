# Multiple RTSP Streams Demo

A simple pipeline demonstrates how multiplexed processing works in Savant. In the demo, two RTSP streams are ingested in the module and processed with the PeopleNet model. 

The resulting streams can be accessed via LL-HLS on `http://locahost:8881/stream` and `http://locahost:8882/stream`.
