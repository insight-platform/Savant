# Simple Pipeline For Testing RTSP Camera Compatibility

This pipeline is a simple pipeline that can be used to test the compatibility of RTSP cameras with Savant. It takes an RTSP stream as input and outputs the stream to HLS. The pipeline can be used to test the compatibility of RTSP cameras with Savant.

It uses NVDEC and NVENC internally and Savant protocol. Thus, if the pipeline works, it means that Savant higly likely will work with the camera.
