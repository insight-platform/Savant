  minDetectorConfidence: 0.0430    # If the confidence of a detector bbox is lower than this, then it won't be considered for tracking

TargetManagement:
  enableBboxUnClipping: 1    # In case the bbox is likely to be clipped by image border, unclip bbox
  preserveStreamUpdateOrder: 0    # When assigning new target ids, preserve input streams' order to keep target ids in a deterministic order over multuple runs
  maxTargetsPerStream: 150    # Max number of targets to track per stream. Recommended to set >10. Note: this value should account for the targets being tracked in shadow mode as well. Max value depends on the GPU memory capacity

  # [Creation & Termination Policy]
  minIouDiff4NewTarget: 0.7418    # If the IOU between the newly detected object and any of the existing targets is higher than this threshold, this newly detected object will be discarded.
  minTrackerConfidence: 0.4009    # If the confidence of an object tracker is lower than this on the fly, then it will be tracked in shadow mode. Valid Range: [0.0, 1.0]
  probationAge: 2    # If the target's age exceeds this, the target will be considered to be valid.
  maxShadowTrackingAge: 51    # Max length of shadow tracking. If the shadowTrackingAge exceeds this limit, the tracker will be terminated.
  earlyTerminationAge: 1    # If the shadowTrackingAge reaches this threshold while in TENTATIVE period, the target will be terminated prematurely.
