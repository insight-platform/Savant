# Fisheye Line Crossing

**NB**: The demo uses **YOLOv7 OBB** model which takes up to **10-15 minutes** to compile to TensorRT engine. The first launch may take a decent time.

The pipeline detects when people cross user-configured lines on a fisheye camera footage. The crossing events are attached to individual tracks, counted for each source separately and the counters are displayed on the frame. The crossing events are also stored with Graphite and displayed on a Grafana dashboard.

Demo utilizes rotated bounding box detector [YOLOv7 OBB](https://github.com/insight-platform/Yolo_V7_OBB_Pruning).

Tracking is performed with the help of [Similari](https://github.com/insight-platform/Similari) tracking library.

Tested on platforms:

- Xavier NX, Xavier AGX;
- Nvidia Turing, Ampere.

Demonstrated operational modes:

- real-time processing: RTSP streams (multiple sources at once);

Demonstrated adapters:

- Video loop adapter;
- Always-ON RTSP sink adapter;

## Prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/insight-platform/Savant.git
cd Savant
git lfs pull
./utils/check-environment-compatible
```

**Note**: Ubuntu 22.04 runtime configuration [guide](https://insight-platform.github.io/Savant/develop/getting_started/0_configure_prod_env.html) helps to configure the runtime to run Savant pipelines.

## Build Engines

The demo uses models that are compiled into TensorRT engines the first time the demo is run. This takes time. Optionally, you can prepare the engines before running the demo by using the command:

```bash
# you are expected to be in Savant/ directory

./samples/fisheye_line_crossing/build_engines.sh
```

## Run Demo

```bash
# you are expected to be in Savant/ directory

# if x86
docker compose -f samples/fisheye_line_crossing/docker-compose.x86.yml up

# if Jetson
docker compose -f samples/fisheye_line_crossing/docker-compose.l4t.yml up

# open 'rtsp://127.0.0.1:554/stream/lab1' in your player
# or visit 'http://127.0.0.1:888/stream/lab1/' (LL-HLS)

# for pre-configured Grafana dashboard visit
# http://127.0.0.1:3000/d/WM6WimE4z/crossings?orgId=1&refresh=5s

# Ctrl+C to stop running the compose bundle
```

To create a custom Grafana dashboard, sign in with `admin\admin` credentials.

## Performance Measurement

Download the video file to the data folder. For example:

```bash
# you are expected to be in Savant/ directory

mkdir -p data
curl -o data/lab1.mp4 https://eu-central-1.linodeobjects.com/savant-data/demo/lab1.mp4
```

Now you are ready to run the performance benchmark with the following command:

```bash
./samples/fisheye_line_crossing/run_perf.sh
```

**Note**: Change the value of the `DATA_LOCATION` variable in the `run_perf.sh` script if you changed the video.
